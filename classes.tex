\section{The \texttt{Job} and \texttt{CurrentJob} Classes}
The \texttt{Job} class is used to represent and operate on existing
jobs.  An object of this class is returned from job \texttt{build()}
calls as well as when retreiving jobs from Urd or a \texttt{JobList}
object.  The \texttt{CurrentJob} class is an extension that provides
mechanisms for operations performed while a job is executing, such as
saving files to the job's jobdir.  The classes are derived from
the \texttt{str} class, and objects of these classes decay to
(unicode) strings when pickled.

The following attributes are available on both the \texttt{Job}
and \texttt{CurrentJob} classes:
\starttabletwo
\texttt{method} & The job method.  This can be overriden by \texttt{name=} if job instance is output from Urd or a \texttt{build()} call.\\
\texttt{path} & The filesystem directory where the job is stored.\\
\texttt{workdir} & The workdir name (the part before \texttt{-number} in the jobid).\\
\texttt{number} & The job number as an \texttt{int}.\\
\texttt{filename()} & Return absolute path to a file in a job.\\
\texttt{withfile()} & A \texttt{JobWithFile} with this job.\\
\texttt{params} & Return a dict corresponding to the file \texttt{setup.json} for this job.\\
\texttt{post} & Return a dict corresponding to \texttt{post.json} for this job.\\
\texttt{open()} & Similar to standard \texttt{open}, use to open files\\
\texttt{load()} & Load a pickle file from the job's directory.\\
\texttt{json\_load()} & Load a json file from the job's directory.\\
\texttt{dataset()} & Return a named dataset from the job.\\
\texttt{datasets} & List of datasets in this job.\\
\texttt{output()} & Return what the job printed to \texttt{stdout} and \texttt{stderr}.\\
\stoptabletwo
\noindent In addition, the \texttt{CurrentJob} class has these
attributes too:
\starttable
\texttt{datasetwriter()} && to get a DatasetWriter object.  See documentation for \texttt{Dataset.DatasetWriter()}, section~\ref{}.\\
\texttt{open()}&& With extra temp argument.\\
\texttt{save()} && to store a pickle file\\
\texttt{json\_save()} && to store a json file\\
\stoptable
\noindent Detailed description of the functions, where neccessary, follows.



\subsection{\texttt{Job.filename()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable
\texttt{filename} & \textsl{Mandatory} & Name of file in job directory.\\
\texttt{sliceno}  & \pyNone & Set to current slice number if sliced, otherwise \pyNone.\\
\stoptable
Return the absolute (full path) filename to a file stored in the job.
If the file is sliced, a particular slice file can be retrieved using
the \texttt{sliceno} parameter.  Sliced files are described in section~\ref{sec:sliced_files}.
%\end{leftbar}



\subsection{\texttt{Job.open()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable
\texttt{filename} & \textsl{Mandatory} & Name of file.\\
\texttt{mode} & \texttt{r} & Open file in this mode, see Python's \texttt{open()}\\
\texttt{sliceno} & \pyNone & Read or write sliced files.\\
\texttt{encoding} & \pyNone & Same as Python's \texttt{open()}\\
\texttt{errors} & \pyNone & Same as Python's \texttt{open()}\\
\texttt{temp} & \pyNone & Control file persistence.  See text.\\
\stoptable
This is a wrapper around the standard \texttt{open} function with some
extra features.  Note that
\begin{itemize}
\item[--]  \texttt{Job.open()} can only read files, not write
them, and therefore ``\texttt{r}'' flag must be set.
\item[--]  \texttt{CurrentJob.open()} can both read and write.
\item[--]  \texttt{CurrentJob.open()} must be used as a context manager,
like this
\begin{python}
with job.open(...) as fh:
    ....
\end{python}
\item[--]  \texttt{CurrentJob.open()} can use the \texttt{temp} flag to
modify the persistence of written files.
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{temp} argument is used to control the persistence of files
written using \texttt{.open()}.  This is useful mainly for debug
purposes, and explained in section~\ref{sec:debugflag}.  Sliced files
are described in section~\ref{sec:slicedfiles}.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{Job.withfile()}}
%\begin{leftbar}

\texttt{filename} & \textsl{Mandatory} & Name of file.\\
\texttt{sliced} & \pyFalse & Boolean indicating if the file is sliced or not.\\
\texttt{extra} & \pyNone & Any additional information to the job to be built.\\
\stoptable
The \texttt{.withfile()} is used to highlight a specific file in a job
and feed it to another job \texttt{build()}.  The file could be
sliced.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{Job.load()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable

\stoptable
Load a file from a job, in JSON format.
%The \texttt{unicode\_as\_utf8bytes} flag is active in Python2 in order
%to let strings decode as bytes.  Override this for unicode.  In
%Python3, strings decode as unicode.
%\end{leftbar}

\texttt{filename} & \texttt{result.pickle} & \\
\texttt{sliceno} & \pyNone & \\
\texttt{temp} & \pyNone & \\
\stoptable
For \texttt{CurrentJob} instances only.  Save data into the current
job's directory in Python's pickle format.
The \texttt{temp} argument is used to control the persistence of files
written using \texttt{.save()}.  This is useful mainly for debug
purposes, and explained in section~\ref{sec:debugflag}.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{Job.json\_save()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable
\texttt{obj} & \textsl{Mandatory} & \\
\texttt{filename} & \texttt{result.json} & \\
\texttt{sliceno} & \pyNone & \\
\texttt{sort\_keys} & \pyTrue & \\
\texttt{temp} & \pyNone & \\
\stoptable
For \texttt{CurrentJob} instances only.  Save data into the current
job's directory in JSON format.
The \texttt{temp} argument is used to control the persistence of files
written using \texttt{.json\_save()}.  This is useful mainly for debug
purposes, and explained in section~\ref{sec:debugflag}.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{Sliced Files}
\label{sec:slicedfiles}
%\begin{leftbar}
A \textsl{sliced} file is actually a set of files used to store data
independently in each \analysis process using a common name.  The
functions that operate on files, such as for example \texttt{.open()}
and \texttt{.load()}, can switch to sliced files using
the \texttt{sliceno} parameter.  From a user's perspective, they
always appear to work on single files.  For example
\begin{python}
def analysis(sliceno, job):
    data = ...
    job.date(data, "mydata", sliceno=sliceno, temp=False)
\end{python}
will create a set of files \texttt{mydata.\%d}, where \texttt{\%d} is
replaced by the slice number.  In this way, data can be passed ``in
parallel'' between different jobs.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{File Persistence}
\label{sec:debugflag}
The \texttt{temp} argument controls persistence of files stored
using \texttt{.open()}, \texttt{.save()}, or \texttt{.json\_save()}.
By default it is being set to \pyFalse, which implies that the stored
file is \textsl{not} temporary.  But setting it to \pyTrue, like in
the following
\begin{python}
job.save(data, filename, temp=True)
\end{python}
will cause the stored file to be deleted upon job completion.  The
functionality can be combined with the \textsl{debug} mode, see below.
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}ll}
  \texttt{temp}      & ``normal'' mode     & debug mode  \\\hline
  \pyFalse           & stored              & stored\\
  \pyTrue            & stored and removed  & stored\\
\end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\end{snugshade}
\noindent Debug mode is active if the Accelerator \texttt{daemon} is
started with the \texttt{---debug} flag.


\clearpage
\section{The \texttt{JobWithFile} Class}
The \texttt{JobWithFile} class is used to create a job input parameter
from a file stored in a job.
\starttabletwo
\texttt{resolve()} & Return filename. \\
\texttt{load()} & load file contents. \\
\texttt{json\_load()} & load JSON file contents.\\
\stoptabletwo
All three functions take the argument \texttt{sliceno}, which default
is set to \pyNone, indicating that it is actually a single file on
disk.  If \texttt{sliceno} is set, it is assumed that the file is
sliced, see section~\ref{sec:slicedfiles}, and the function will look
up that slice of the file only.



\clearpage
\section{The \texttt{JobList} Class}
Objects of the \texttt{JobList} class are returned by member functions
to the \texttt{Urd} class.  They are used to group sessions of jobs
together.
\starttabletwo
\texttt{find()} & Return a new \texttt{JobList} with only jobs with that method or name in it.\\
\texttt{get()} & Return the latest \texttt{Job} with that method or name.\\
\texttt{[<method>]} & Same as \texttt{.get} but error if no job with that method or name is in the list.\\
\texttt{as\_tuples} &  The \texttt{JobList} represented as \texttt{(method, jid)} \texttt{tuple}s.\\
\texttt{pretty} & Return a prettified string version of the \texttt{JobList}.\\
\texttt{exectime} & Execution times in total as well as per method.\\
\texttt{print\_exectimes()} & Print execution time information to \texttt{stdout}.\\
\stoptabletwo
\noindent Detailed description of the functions, where neccessary, follows.

\texttt{method} & \textsl{Mandatory} & Method or name to find.\\
\stoptable
Return a new \texttt{Joblist} will all jobs in the
current \texttt{JobList} matching the \texttt{method} argument.  The
matching part is either the unique name of the method's source code,
or the name optionally given at build time using the \texttt{name=}
argument.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{JobList.get()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable
\texttt{method} & \textsl{Mandatory} & Method or name to find.\\
\texttt{default} & \pyNone & Return the latest matching job.\\
\stoptable
Return the latest job that matches the \texttt{method} argument.  The
matching part is either the unique name of the method's source code,
or the name optionally given at build time using the \texttt{name=}
argument.  If no matches are found, it will return
the \texttt{default} argument.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{JobList.print\_exectimes()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable
\texttt{verbose} & \pyTrue & In addition to total time, print execution time for each method in list.\\
\stoptable
Print total execution time for the \texttt{Joblist}, and,
conditionally, execution time for each job in the list,
to \texttt{stdout}.
%\end{leftbar}



\clearpage
\section{The \texttt{Dataset} Class}
The \texttt{Dataset} class is used to operate on small or large
datasets stored on disk.  It decays to a (unicode) string when
pickled.

\starttabletwo
\texttt{columns} & A \texttt{dict} from column to properties, such as type, min, and max values.\\
\texttt{previous} & The dataset's previous dataset, if it exists, \pyNone otherwise.\\
\texttt{parent} & The dataset's parent dataset, if it exists, \pyNone otherwise.\\
\texttt{filename} & The dataset's filename, if it exists.  (\texttt{csvimport} sets this.)\\
\texttt{hashlabel} & Column used for hash partitioning, or \pyNone.\\
\texttt{caption} & The dataset's caption.\\
\texttt{lines} & A \texttt{list} with number of lines per slice.\\
\texttt{shape} & A tuple containing number of columns and number of lines in dataset.\\
\texttt{link\_to\_here()} & Used to associate a subjob's dataset with the current job, see section~\ref{sec:linktohere}.\\
\texttt{merge()} & Merge this dataset with another dataset, see section~\ref{sec:datasetmerge}.\\
\texttt{chain()} & A \texttt{DatasetChain} object, see section~\ref{sec:dschain}\\
\texttt{iterate\_chain()} & Iterator over chains, see section~\ref{sec:iterator}.\\

\subsection{\texttt{Dataset.link\_to\_here()}}
%\begin{leftbar}
\starttable
\texttt{name} & \texttt{default} & The new name of the dataset.\\
\texttt{column\_filter} & \pyNone & Iterable of columns to include, or \pyNone to get all.\\
\texttt{override\_previous} & \texttt{\_no\_override} & Set this to the new previous.\\
\stoptable
Use this to expose a subjob as a dataset in your job, like in this
example:
\begin{python}
def synthesis():
    job = build('ex')
    job.dataset().link_to_here(name='new')
\end{python}
The current job will now appear to have a dataset named \texttt{new},
that is actually a link to the subjob's \texttt{default} dataset.  It
is possible to filter which columns should be visible in the link
using \texttt{column\_filter}.  For chaining purposes, it is possible
for the link to expose a parent dataset of choice, set using
the \texttt{override\_previous} parameter.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{Dataset.merge()}}

\starttable
\texttt{other} & \textsl{Mandatory} & Merge with this dataset.\\
\texttt{name} & ``\texttt{default}''& Name of new dataset\\
\texttt{previous} & \pyNone& The new dataset's \texttt{previous} dataset.\\
\texttt{allow\_unrelated} & \pyFalse& Set this if the datasets do not share a common ancestor.\\
\stoptable
Merge this and other dataset. Columns from the other dataset take
priority.  If datasets do not have a common ancestor you get an error
unless \texttt{allow\_unrelated} is set. The new dataset always has
the previous specified here (even if \pyNone).  Returns the new
dataset.
%\end{leftbar}


\subsection{\texttt{Dataset.chain()}}

\section{The \texttt{DatasetWriter} Class}
The \texttt{DatasetWriter} class is used to create datasets.  Datasets
could be stand-alone, part of a chain, or an extension (new columns)
to an existing dataset.

The class has a number of member functions, described below, that may
be used for dataset creation.  Alternatively, the new dataset could be
set up using the \texttt{DatasetWriter} \textsl{constructor}.  The
constructor approach is currently only documented in the source code,
see \texttt{dataset.py}.

%Sadly, \input breaks the build. If pdflatex encounters a missing
%\input file, it generates an error (instead of a warning like with
%\include), and stops compiling. Yes, latexmk will generate the file
%and re-start pdflatex, but this is inefficient, and breaks completely
%if you have multiple such file references, because eventually the
%compile will end with a ``too many re-runs'' message.  John Collins'
%answer to my question regarding this provides a workaround for this.

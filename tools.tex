\newcommand{\cmd}{\texttt{ax}\xspace}





The Accelerator is controlled using the \cmd shell command.  In order
to run any command, \cmd needs to have access to a configuration file
(see section~\ref{sec:configfile}).  The \cmd command will look for this file first
in the current directory, and then recursively in directories above
it.

It is assumed that the Accelerator server and build script
\texttt{run} commands are executed from the same directory.  This will
work out of the box.  But if set up correctly, they could be run from
different directories or even from different computers if necessary.

Asking for help is always an option.  To begin,
\begin{shell}
ax --help
\end{shell}
will print something like
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax [--config CONFIG_FILE] command [args]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG_FILE  configuration file
  --version             alias for the version command

commands:

    abort  abort running job(s)
    board  runs a webserver for displaying results
     curl  http request (with curl) to urd or the server
       ds  display information about datasets
     grep  search for a pattern in one or more datasets
     init  create a project directory
      job  information about a job
   method  information about methods
      run  run a build script
   server  run the main server
      urd  run the urd server
  version  show installed accelerator version
  workdir  information about workdirs

aliases:
cat = grep ""

use ax <command> --help for <command> usage
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}
\noindent each command will be introduced next.





\section{Initialisation: \texttt{ax init}}
\label{sec:initialisation}
In order to start a new project, a few things need to be set up, in
particular
\begin{itemize}
\item[] identify existing / create new \textsl{workdirs},
\item[] identify existing / create new \textsl{method packages}, and
\item[] write a \textsl{configuration file}.
\end{itemize}
This can be done manually, but a simple way to start from scratch is
to use the \texttt{init} command
\begin{shell}
ax init
\end{shell}
with the following options
\begin{shell}
ax init --help
\end{shell}
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax init [-h] [--slices SLICES] [--name NAME] [--input INPUT] [--force]
                    [--tcp [HOST/PORT]] [--no-git] [DIR]

creates an accelerator project directory.
defaults to the current directory.
creates accelerator.conf, a method dir, a workdir and result dir.
both the method directory and workdir will be named <NAME>,
"dev" by default.

positional arguments:
  DIR                project directory to create. default "."

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --slices SLICES    override slice count detection
  --name NAME        name of method dir and workdir, default "dev"
  --input INPUT      input directory
  --force            go ahead even though directory is not empty, or workdir
                     exists with incompatible slice count
  --tcp [HOST/PORT]  listen on TCP instead of unix sockets.
                     specify HOST (can be IP) to listen on that host
                     specify PORT to use range(PORT, PORT + 3)
                     specify both as HOST:PORT
  --no-git           don't create git repository
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}



\section{Accelerator Server: \texttt{ax server}}

The Accelerator server, or daemon, needs to be running in order to
execute any commands.
\begin{shell}
ax server
\end{shell}
will start the Accelerator server, assuming that a configuration file
that makes sense is in place.
\begin{shell}
ax server --help
\end{shell}
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax server [-h] [--debug]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --debug
\end{verbatim}%
\end{snugshade}
Communication with the Accelerator server will take place over an UNIX
socket by default.  There is no need for any additional configuration
to make that happen.  It is possible, however, to communicate over a
TCP port instead if specified in the Accelerator's configuration file.





\section{Running Build Scripts: \texttt{ax run}}
\label{sec:exec_runner}
Build scripts are executed using
\begin{python}
ax run <script>
\end{python}

\begin{python}
ax run --help
\end{python}

\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax run [options] [script]

positional arguments:
  script                build script to run. default "build".
                        searches under all method directories in alphabetical
                        order if it does not contain a dot.
                        prefixes build_ to last element unless specified.
                        package name suffixes are ok.
                        so for example "test_methods.tests" expands to
                        "accelerator.test_methods.build_tests".

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FLAGS, --flags FLAGS
                        comma separated list of flags
  -q, --quick           skip method updates and checking workdirs for new jobs
  -c SPEC, --concurrency SPEC
                        set max concurrency for methods, either method=N
                        or just N to set for all other methods
  -w WORKDIR, --workdir WORKDIR
                        build in this workdir
                        set_workdir() and workdir= override this.
  -W, --just_wait       just wait for running job, don't run any build script
  -F, --fullpath        print full path to jobdirs
  --verbose VERBOSE     verbosity style {no, status, dots, log}
  --quiet               same as --verbose=no
  --horizon HORIZON     time horizon - dates after this are not visible in
                        urd.latest
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}
When the \texttt{run} command starts, it will instruct the Accelerator
to scan all method directories to see if there are any new or changed
methods.  Thereafter, the Accelerator will proceed and scan all source
workdirs to see if any new jobs have been created (by another
Accelerator server).  Thereafter, it will execute the build script.




\section{Dataset Information: \texttt{ax ds}}
The \texttt{ds} command gives a compact, but easy to read,
overview of either
\begin{itemize}
\item[] a dataset,
\item[] a chain of datasets, or
\item[] available datasets in a job directory.
\end{itemize}
it provides information about column names and types, max and min
values, number of rows, and balance of rows between slices.
\begin{shell}
  usage: ax ds [options] ds [ds [...]]

  positional arguments:
  dataset               the job part of the dataset name can be specified in
                        the same ways as for ``ax job''. you can use ds~ or
                        ds~N to follow the chain N steps backwards, or ^ to
                        follow .parent. this requires specifying the ds-name,
                        so wd-1~ will not do this, but wd-1/default~ will.

  optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --chain           list all datasets in a chain
  -C, --non-empty-chain
  list all non-empty datasets in a chain
  -l, --list            list all datasets in a job with number of rows
  -L, --chainedlist     list all datasets in a job with number of chained rows
  -m, --suppress-minmax
  do not print min/max column values
  -n, --suppress-columns
  do not print columns
  -q, --suppress-errors
  silently ignores bad input datasets/jobids
  -s, --slices          list relative number of lines per slice in sorted order
  -S, --chainedslices   same as -s but for full chain
  -w, --location        show where (ds/filename) each column is stored
\end{shell}

The \texttt{dataset} option is either a \textsl{dataset}, when used
with the \texttt{-s}, \texttt{-S}, and \texttt{-c} options, or a
\textsl{jobid} when used with \texttt{-l} option.  Datasets or jobids
could be either names or absolute paths.  Examples of valid datasets
are \texttt{test-2}, \texttt{test-2/default}, and
\texttt{/home/wdirs/test/test2/dsx}.  Of these, only \texttt{test-2}
is a valid jobid.
Here are all options
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{9cm}}
  \texttt{-h}\hspace{3cm}\texttt{---help} & show help message and exit.\\[4ex]
  \texttt{-q}\hspace{3cm}\texttt{---quiet} & Silently ignore any error.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{snugshade}
When \texttt{ds} is fed with dataset(s)
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{9cm}}
  \texttt{-c}\hspace{3cm}\texttt{---chain} & Print name and number of
  lines for all datasets in the chain.\\[4ex]
  \texttt{-s}\hspace{3cm}\texttt{---slices} & Print absolute and
  relative number of lines per slice for the input dataset.\\[2ex]
  \texttt{-S}\hspace{3cm}\texttt{---chain} & Same as \texttt{-s}, but
  data is for the whole chain of datasets.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{snugshade}
When \texttt{ds} is fed with jobid(s)
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{9cm}}
  \texttt{-l}\hspace{3cm}\texttt{---list} & Print the name and number
  of lines of all datasets in the input jobid.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{snugshade}

\subsubsection*{Example invocation 1}
\begin{shell}
ax ds test-20 -S
\end{shell}
or
\begin{shell}
ax ds test-20/badlines
\end{shell}

The argument can be one or more jobids or dataset ids.  If the
argument is a jobid, it is assumed that the dataset name is
\texttt{default}.  If there are more than one dataset in the job, a
list of dataset names will be returned.

\subsubsection*{Example invocation 2}
Combining \texttt{ds} will shell features can be an elegant way to
extract information from a workdir.  For example
\begin{shell}
ax ds -l -q test-{0..99}
\end{shell}
will scan for datasets in the 100 first jobs of \texttt{test}.
Adding the \texttt{-q} option will make \texttt{ds} suppress the
warning messages for those jobs that do not contain any datasets.

\subsubsection*{Example invocation 3}
Find all datasets in \texttt{test-20}
\begin{shell}
ax ds -l test-20
\end{shell}

\subsubsection*{Example Output}

          0:   4.43% (6,472,949)   17:   4.35% (6,363,206)   19:   4.31% (6,309,295)

          4:   4.39% (6,421,043)   15:   4.35% (6,358,757)    8:   4.31% (6,304,311)
          6:   4.39% (6,418,617)    7:   4.34% (6,352,750)   13:   4.31% (6,303,637)
         14:   4.39% (6,417,911)   18:   4.34% (6,348,128)    5:   4.28% (6,252,735)
          2:   4.36% (6,376,139)   10:   4.34% (6,347,694)   16:   4.26% (6,230,543)

    Max to average ratio: 1.020
    146,235,260 total lines in chain
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}
The \texttt{max to average ratio} shows the ratio between the slice
with most rows and the average number of rows.  This can be
interpreted as the execution time overhead for a dataset where all
slices are not of the same size.  When the ratio is close to one, the
dataset is perfectly balanced.


\section{Look at Specific Data in a Dataset: \texttt{ax grep}}
The \texttt{grep} command is a parallel grep for datasets that is
used to look at data stored in datasets or dataset chains.
\begin{shell}
  usage: ax grep [options] pattern ds [ds [...]] [column [column [...]]

    positional arguments:
    pattern
    dataset               can be specified in the same ways as for ``ax ds''
    columns

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c, --chain           follow dataset chains
    -C, --color           color matched text
    -i, --ignore-case     case insensitive pattern
    -H, --headers         print column names before output (and on each change)
    -o, --ordered         output in order (one slice at a time)
    -g COLUMN, --grep COLUMN
    grep this column only, can be specified multiple times
    -s SLICE, --slice SLICE
    grep this slice only, can be specified multiple times
    -t SEPARATOR, --separator SEPARATOR
    field separator (default tab)
    -D, --show-dataset    show dataset on matching lines
    -S, --show-sliceno    show sliceno on matching lines
    -L, --show-lineno     show lineno (per slice) on matching lines
\end{shell}
\noindent The \texttt{pattern} is a regular expression and \texttt{ds} are
datasets.  For example
\begin{shell}
ax grep Alice test-0 test-1/special name
\end{shell}
Will look for the string \texttt{Alice} in the \texttt{name} column of
the two datasets \texttt{text-0} and \texttt{test-1/special}.

Strings and columns with special characters have to be quoted.


\section{Information about Methods: \texttt{ax method}}
Use \texttt{ax method} to print a list of available methods together
with an optional description.
\begin{shell}
ax method
\end{shell}
The method description is shown by specifying a method name
\begin{shell}
ax method csvimport
\end{shell}
Descriptions are added using the \texttt{description="some string"}
statement in a method.



\section{Aliases}
It is possible to create aliases for common tasks.
@@@@HOWTO?


\section{Show Dataset Contents: \texttt{ax cat}}
The data in a dataset may be printed to \texttt{stdout} using the
\texttt{cat} alias, for example like this
\begin{shell}
ax cat test-0 | less
\end{shell}
This is an alias for \texttt{ax grep ""}, which greps a dataset for the
empty regexp, which matches every line.





\section{The Urd Job Database Server: \texttt{ax urd}}
By default, a local Urd server is running when the Accelerator server
is running.  Read more about this in section~\ref{chap:urd}.

Start Urd by
\begin{shell}
ax urd
\end{shell}
These are the options
\begin{shell}
ax urd --help
\end{shell}
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: urd [-h] [--port PORT] [--path PATH]

optional arguments:
-h, --help   show this help message and exit
--port PORT  server port (default: 8080)
--path PATH  database directory (can be relative to project directory)
(default: ./urd.db)
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}
Remember to set matching values in the Accelerator's configuration
file so that it can find the Urd server.


\subsection{Authorization to Urd}
Authorisation to Urd could be set in the \texttt{URD\_AUTH}
environment variable.  A common way to invoke the run command with Urd
authorisation is like this
\begin{shell}
URD_AUTH=user:passwd ax run [script]
\end{shell}
Note that the purpose of the authentication is
actually \textsl{identification}.  It is used to get write access to
certain Urd lists.  Nothing more.


\section{Aborting a Running Job: \texttt{ax abort}}
The command \texttt{ax abort} will abort any running job.  To abort an
entire build script, first type \texttt{Ctrl-C} followed by \texttt{ax
  abort}.
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax abort [-h] [-q]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet  no output
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}


\section{Current Version: \texttt{ax version}}
Use \texttt{ax version} to find the currently running version.  The
Accelerator will complain if the \texttt{ax} command version does not
match the currently running server.


\section{Workdir Information: \texttt{ax workdir}}
By itself, \texttt{ax workdir} will print a list of all current
workdirs.  By specifying a workdir, all jobs in that workdir, together
with execution time and information if it is \textsl{old} or
\textsl{current} will be listed.  All jobs in all workdirs will be
listed using the \texttt{-a} option.
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax workdir [-a | [workdir [workdir [...]]]

  positional arguments:
  workdirs

  optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a, --all   list all workdirs
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}


\section{The Urd Server: \texttt{ax urd}}
The Urd server is started by \texttt{ax server} by default.  It is
possible to set up a separate Urd server, for example for a larger
project with several participants, see section~\ref{sec:urd_setup}.
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax abort [-h] [-q]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet  no output
[eaenbrd][13:56:46][~/beast] ax urd --help                                                                                                                                                                                                     (git)-[master] 
usage: ax urd urd [-h] [--path PATH] [--allow-passwordless] [--quiet]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH           database directory (can be relative to project directory) (default: urd.db)
  --allow-passwordless  accept any pass for users not in passwd.
  --quiet               less chatty.
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}


\section{The Board Web Server: \texttt{ax board}}
The Board server is a web server that exposes information about jobs
and results through the use of a standard web browser.  This is
started by default by the \texttt{ax server} command, but it can be
started separately using \texttt{ax board}.
\begin{snugshade}
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ax board [listen_on]
runs a web server on listen_on (default localhost:8520, can be socket path)
for displaying results (result_directory)
\end{verbatim}
\end{snugshade}


\section{Displaying Urd Database Content: \texttt{ax curl}}
The \texttt{ax curl} command is just a shorthand for the general
\texttt{curl} tool.  It is used to query information from the Urd
transactional database.  See section~\ref{sec:urd-api} for infomation
on how to use it.

\section{\texttt{dsinfo} -- Dataset Information}
The \texttt{dsinfo} command line tool gives a compact, but easy to
read, overview of a dataset or a dataset chain.  The tool is located
in the \texttt{accelerator} home directory, and the full file name is
\texttt{dsinfo.py}.  Example invocation
\begin{shell}
% ./dsinfo.py test-20
\end{shell}
The argument can be one or more jobids or dataset ids.  If the
argument is a jobid, it is assumed that the dataset name is
\texttt{default}.  If there are more than one dataset in the job, a
list of dataset names will be returned.


\section{\texttt{dsgrep} -- Find Data in Dataset}

\subsection{Abuse dsgrep to show datasets}
The data in a dataset may be printed to \texttt{stdout} by
\texttt{grep}ing using a regexp that always matches, like this
\begin{shell}
./dsgrep.py . test-0
\end{shell}
